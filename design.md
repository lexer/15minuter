# Design Document — BTC 15-Minute Trading Agent

## Overview

Autonomous TypeScript agent that trades `KXBTC15M` Bitcoin price-direction markets on Kalshi. Each market is a 15-minute binary: YES resolves to $1 if BTC closes the window above its open price, NO if below. The agent enters late in the window (final 1–5 minutes) when the outcome is highly probable but unexpired upside remains.

Process isolation: all files use the `btc_` prefix (`btc_agent.pid`, `btc_agent_YYYY-MM-DD.log`, `btc_errors.log`, `btc_trade_history.json`) so the agent can run alongside other Kalshi agents in the same directory.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. RSA-PSS Authentication
Kalshi requires RSA-PSS signatures. Message: `{timestamp_ms}{METHOD}{/trade-api/v2/path}`. `KALSHI_API_KEY` holds the key UUID; private key in `private_key.pem` (never committed). Same scheme for WebSocket upgrade headers.

### 2. WebSocket Watchdog
90-second inactivity watchdog resets on every inbound frame. If Kalshi's 10s heartbeat misses ~9 beats, the socket is terminated and reconnected with fresh auth. Set to 90s (up from 45s) after observing false-positive reconnects at 15-minute window boundaries: Kalshi's WS goes quiet between windows, causing the 45s watchdog to fire spuriously ~6 times per day.

### 3. BTC Price Data — CF Benchmarks BRTI
`BtcPriceMonitor` connects to the CF Benchmarks BRTI WebSocket (`wss://www.cfbenchmarks.com/ws/v4`).
- BRTI (Bitcoin Real-Time Index) ticks every **1 second**, sourced from Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, etc.
- KXBTC15M markets resolve on the **60-second simple average** of BRTI immediately before close vs the **60-second simple average** of BRTI immediately before the window opened (`floor_strike`).
- The monitor maintains a **rolling 20-minute price history** (cleared on disconnect) used by the probability model to compute realized interval volatility.
- Credentials (WS key ID + password) are scraped from the CF Benchmarks BRTI page and refreshed every 15 minutes.

### 4. BTC Probability Model — Gaussian Random Walk with Interval Realized Vol
```
Resolution: P(60s-avg-at-close ≥ floor_strike)   where floor_strike = 60s-avg-at-open
priceChangeFraction = (currentBRTI − floor_strike) / floor_strike
σ_eff = resolveSigma(intervalPrices, momentum)
z     = priceChangeFraction / (σ_eff × √secondsLeft) + score × 1.5
prob  = Φ(z)
```

**Sigma priority (per √second):**
1. **Interval realized vol** — std of log-returns from BRTI prices since `closeTime − 15min`. Requires ≥10 returns. Clamped to [0.5σ, 3σ] of static. Captures the volatility regime of the *specific current window*.
2. **Momentum dynamic sigma** — last-30-tick realized vol from `BtcMomentumIndicators`.
3. **Static sigma** — `0.0001424` from 80% annual BTC vol.

Example: BTC up 0.5% vs floor_strike, 60s left, low-vol interval (σ = 0.5×static) → z ≈ 9.0 → prob ≈ 100%.

**Settlement model** (final 60 seconds):
In the final 60s, BRTI samples are accumulated. The expected closing 60-second average is projected:
```
expectedAvg = (partialSum + secondsLeft × currentBRTI) / 60
σ_avg = σ_eff × secondsLeft × √(secondsLeft/3) / 60
z = (expectedAvg − floor_strike) / (floor_strike × σ_avg)
```
Confidence sharpens as more samples accumulate.

### 5. Blended Win Probability (analysis only)
```
winProbability = 0.3 × marketMid + 0.7 × btcGaussianModel
```
Computed every tick and written to the analysis log. **Not used for trading decisions** — entry and exit are gated solely on market ask/bid price levels. The model was removed from the decision path because momentum and market-mid blending produced inflated estimates (e.g. 91.9% from a +0.016% price lead), causing premature entries and blocking valid exits.

### 6. Trading Window — Entry and Market Discovery
Only trade in the final **120 seconds** of each 15-minute window (up to and including market close):
- The 120-second ceiling starts 60 seconds before the 60-second BRTI averaging window begins, capturing more directional price information.
- No minimum floor: entries and exit management continue right up to market close.

`isInTradingWindow = secondsLeft ∈ [0, 120]` is computed from `market.closeTime - Date.now()`.

### 7. Entry Criteria
Entry is evaluated symmetrically for YES and NO sides. Market ask price is the **sole gate** — model probability is logged but does not influence entry.

**YES entry** (bullish):
1. Market must be `active` or `open`; `isInTradingWindow = true` (secondsLeft ≤ 120)
2. YES ask **> 85¢ and ≤ 98¢** — R:R at 85¢: max win 15¢, hard stop loss 25¢ (breakeven ~63%)
3. Size: `min($10 window budget, available cash) / yesAsk` contracts

**NO entry** (bearish):
1. Market must be `active` or `open`; `isInTradingWindow = true` (secondsLeft ≤ 120)
2. NO ask **> 85¢ and ≤ 98¢** (i.e. YES bid **< 15¢**)
3. Size: `min($10 window budget, available cash) / noAsk` contracts

No confirmation window. IOC order semantics: a momentary ask spike with no real liquidity results in an unfilled order, not a bad fill.

**NO bid/ask derivation**: WS ticker messages only carry YES prices. NO prices are derived on every tick:
```
noAsk = 1 − yesBid   (price to buy NO; counterparty sells NO = buys YES at yesBid)
noBid = 1 − yesAsk   (price to sell NO; counterparty buys NO = sells YES at yesAsk)
```
This ensures NO entry IOC orders use the current market price, not a stale REST-fetched value.

### 8. Exit Criteria (evaluated in priority order each tick)
Bid price is the sole gate — model probability is logged in reason strings but does not influence exit decisions.

1. **bid ≥ 99¢** → take profit: sell immediately, locking in near-maximum gain
2. **bid ≤ 60¢** → hard stop: sell immediately, no confirmation
3. **60¢ < bid < 99¢** → hold

Worst-case loss per contract: entry at ≥90¢, hard stop at 60¢ = ~30¢.
Maximum gain per contract: entry at ≤98¢, take profit at 99¢+ = 1–9¢ (plus settlement at $1.00).

Positions are never force-exited by time. Exit is triggered solely by bid price levels above, or by market settlement. Open positions continue to be evaluated on every ticker tick regardless of how much time is left.

### 9. Position Sizing — Window Budget
Budget = **$10 per 15-minute window** (constant, not derived from account balance).
```
maxSpendCents = min(WINDOW_BUDGET_CENTS = 1000, availableBalanceCents)
contracts     = floor(maxSpendCents / askCents)
```
Top-up logic: if a partially-filled entry is below the window budget target, additional contracts are bought on subsequent ticks while still in the entry window and ask is above threshold.

### 10. Process Isolation
All runtime files use the `btc_` prefix to avoid collisions with other agents:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `btc_agent.pid` | Single-instance lock |
| `btc_agent_YYYY-MM-DD.log` | Agent stdout (PST-dated) |
| `btc_errors.log` | Errors (transient network errors excluded) |
| `logs/analysis/<ticker>.log` | Per-tick JSON-lines analysis log (one file per ticker) |
| `btc_trade_history.json` | All trade records |

### 11. Logging
Analysis logs are written to `logs/analysis/<ticker>.log` — one file per Kalshi market per 15-minute window (HH-MM = window close time in PST). One JSON-lines entry per **WebSocket ticker tick**, written for all subscribed markets at all times (not limited to the trading window). Each entry includes:
- BTC state: `currentPrice`, market snapshots for all tracked markets
- Market snapshots: `ticker`, `targetPrice` (`floor_strike`), `sixtySecondsAvg`, `priceChangePct`, `winProbability`, `ask`, `bid`, `secondsLeft`, optional `signal`/`signalReason`
- `sixtySecondsAvg` is **always present** (not gated on settlement window):
  - Pre-settlement: `currentBRTI` (flat projection — outcome if BRTI stays constant)
  - Settlement window (final 60s): `(mean(samples) × elapsed + currentBRTI × secondsLeft) / 60`
- `priceChangePct` is always `(sixtySecondsAvg − targetPrice) / targetPrice × 100`
- Entry/exit decisions with fill status and order ID
- Open positions with unrealized PnL
- Summary: `totalTrades`, `realizedPnl`, `unrealizedPnl`, `winRate`

## Trade Lifecycle

```
[on start]
  REST: getAllLiveBtcMarkets() + getBalance() in parallel
  WS:   connect to wss://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/ws/v2
  WS:   subscribe fill, market_positions, all discovered tickers

[on WS ticker message]
  applyTickerUpdate() → recompute secondsLeft + blended prob
  if open position OR isInTradingWindow:
    startTick → logBrtiState([market]) → handleMarket() → logOpenPositions → finalizeTick
    (one analysis log entry per WS tick per qualifying market)

[every 5s — btcStateLoop]
  BRTI: refreshBtcStates()
  log console status only (no analysis write)

[every 30s — marketDiscoveryLoop]
  REST: discoverMarkets() → WS subscribe/unsubscribe

[every 10s — balanceRefreshLoop]
  REST: getBalance() to correct WS-optimistic drift

[every 15s — reconcileLoop]
  REST: getPortfolio() + getOpenOrders()
  adopt external positions; detect external closes

[on WS fill]     optimistically adjust cachedBalanceCents; correct fill price in TradeHistory
[on WS position] detect real-time position close; mark trade closed
```

## Fill Price Correction
WS fill messages arrive before or after the REST order response. The `fillAccumulator` map accumulates fills by `orderId`; `orderTradeMap` maps `orderId` to `tradeId`. Once accumulated fills match the expected contract count, the trade record is corrected from the submitted limit price to the actual weighted-average execution price.
